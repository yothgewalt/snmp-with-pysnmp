"""
This module initializes the versioning information for the pysnmp package.

Attributes:
    __version__ (str): The current version of the pysnmp package.
    main_version (str): The main version string, used to prevent semantic release from updating the version in multiple places.
    version (tuple): A tuple representation of the version, where each part of the version string is converted to an integer.
    major_version_id (int): The major version number extracted from the version tuple.

Notes:
    - For backward compatibility, if the version string contains "beta", the string part is removed before converting to a tuple.
